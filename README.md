# **Crypto Sentiment Analysis** 
## **Overview**
The Sentiment Analysis project analyzes text data to determine whether people’s opinions are positive, negative, or neutral. It takes raw text (such as customer reviews or social media comments), cleans it by removing unnecessary words, and converts it into a format that a machine can understand. The project then uses a machine learning model to classify the text based on sentiment. It also includes visualizations to show trends in sentiment. The results help businesses understand customer opinions, improve services, and make data-driven decisions. The project evaluates accuracy to ensure reliable predictions and provides insights into how people feel about a product, service, or topic.

## **Dataset Description**
The Sentiment Analysis project utilizes a dataset comprising text entries, each labeled to indicate the sentiment expressed—positive, negative, or neutral. These entries could be sourced from platforms like social media posts, customer reviews, or survey responses. Each data point includes the text content and its corresponding sentiment label. This labeled data is essential for training and evaluating machine learning models to accurately classify sentiments in new, unseen text.
