# **Crypto Sentiment Analysis** 
**Overview**
The Sentiment Analysis project analyzes text data to determine whether peopleâ€™s opinions are positive, negative, or neutral. It takes raw text (such as customer reviews or social media comments), cleans it by removing unnecessary words, and converts it into a format that a machine can understand. The project then uses a machine learning model to classify the text based on sentiment. It also includes visualizations to show trends in sentiment. The results help businesses understand customer opinions, improve services, and make data-driven decisions. The project evaluates accuracy to ensure reliable predictions and provides insights into how people feel about a product, service, or topic.
